Objective of project 

AudioBook Generator is a web application that allows users to upload one or more text
documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and automatically converts them into high-quality
audiobooks.

 The application leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to rewrite extracted
text in an engaging, listener-friendly “audiobook style” before using open-source Text-to-
Speech (TTS) technology to produce downloadable audio files. This project enhances
accessibility, productivity, and the enjoyment of written content.
